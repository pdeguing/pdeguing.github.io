title:  "Libft, building your own C library"
---
Libft is the first project to complete after becoming a cadet at 42. The aim of the project is to code some functions from the C standard library and other specific functions that we will need to complete projects in the future. It is important to note that for the majority of the curriculum, we are not allowed to use standard libraries and must rely on our own Libft.

Here is a link to the full subject for this project: [libft.en.pdf](https://github.com/pdeguing/libft/blob/master/libft.en.pdf).

And here is a link to the entire GitHub repository: [pdeguing/libft](https://github.com/pdeguing/libft).

This project is quite wide as it requires you to write more than 50 functions. You can add your own functions on top of that as a bonus. If you are currently working on libft, I would recommend you to split the biggest functions like `ft_strsplit()` into many usefull smaller functions as `ft_countwords()` to count the number of words etc.
