I am a student at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/). I am learning C from scratch and work daily to become an excellent developer. French is my native language and I'm 22. 

I built this blog to share my advancement as I dive deeper into Computer Science. I plan to upload a debrief for each project I complete within 42's curriculum.

There are 3 branches in the program: algorithms, graphics and Unix system. As I want to discover the low-end of operating systems and really like Unix philosophy, I'll jump into this last branch as soon as I can.

You can find all my sourcecodes on GitHub: [pdeguing](https://github.com/pdeguing?tab=repositories)

After completing [EDHEC's](https://www.edhec.edu/) Bachelor in Business Administration in France, I left for Australia to see the world and be sure of what I wanted to achieve in life. Living in the Silicon Valley and contributing to the future is what drives me today.

I want to find a position as a back-end engineer in California. I'm commiting all my ressources daily in order to achieve this goal. Feel free to contact with any opportunity. The best way to do so is by email or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pqdeguingand/).

This website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm just getting started with those tools and still have a lot to learn.
